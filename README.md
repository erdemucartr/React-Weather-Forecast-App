# React Weather Forecast App
 The project is a 4-day weather forecast application built using React. It fetches weather data from a weather API and displays the forecast for the next 4 days. Users can view details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for each day, providing them with valuable insights to plan their activities accordingly.
